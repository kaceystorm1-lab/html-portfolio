<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Kacey Raynor, and I’m a creative designer with a passion for blending 
art and technology. I love exploring the artistic side of web development — turning 
simple code into visually appealing, engaging experiences.</p>

<p>For me, design is more than just how something looks — it’s how it feels. I enjoy working 
with colors, layouts, and typography to create websites that are both functional and 
beautiful. Whether it’s designing clean interfaces, building portfolios, or experimenting 
with creative projects, I focus on crafting work that tells a story and connects with people.</p>

<p>Outside of web design, I find inspiration in art, photography, and 3D printing. 
My goal is to keep growing my skills in HTML, CSS, and design tools so I can continue 
creating projects that combine creativity with purpose.</p>
